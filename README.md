Hi!
My name is Marek. I am new to GitHub and Python and trying here getting familiar with GitHub in first place. Next target of cource is to manage any code I will be hopefully able to produce.

Recently had major problem with Excel - I pulled in sql database for some data analysis but did not notice that only 2 million rows came through. So all my analysis was wrong. I'd like to learn Python for data analytics using pandas, numpy, mathplotlib etc.

One of the problems is that learning takes time and I never have enough time. Hope I can find effective ways for learning. Starting from YouTube and let's see how it's evolving.
